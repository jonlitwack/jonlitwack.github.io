Nielsen said it - we went from CLI as an interface because of keyboards, desktop UI because of Mice, Web Design because of the interwebs, Experience Design because of SaaS, and now we have Chat interfaces because of GenAI.

Highly paraphrased ^^

Similar to Krug's famous "Don't Make Me Think" - it's just a matter of time before people get tired of prompting everything. If you've been playing with GenAI long enough now, there are likely some questions that are getting boring to ask.

Here are a few I'd be happy to never fully type out again:

"I have [ingredients] what can I make with them for dinner"
"Help me plan out this trip knowing that [details]"
"Write a speech about this person that I probably shouldn't phone it in for. Here's what you should know about them..."

My point with these examples isn't that they're tedious... Though once you've done it ten times, the magic starts to leak out. No. My point is that each of these represent common, repeated patterns that we as humans tend to all perform at some point or another.

There is a future that we're entering into right now - in which we get to observe, or re-observe human patterns, and once again create things that remove the toil of thinking and, typing.

Chatbots are the new CLI. Knowledge of the command line, means complete power over your computer. Prompts will likely always provide full power over a model, but they'll always take a backseat to a button that handles the task 10x faster.
