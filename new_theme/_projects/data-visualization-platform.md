# Data Visualization Platform

An AI-powered analytics dashboard designed to transform complex data into actionable insights for a global financial services company.

## The Challenge

The client needed a way to visualize vast amounts of transaction data in real-time, allowing decision-makers to identify trends and anomalies quickly.

## The Solution

Leveraging AI and advanced data visualization techniques, I created a responsive dashboard that:

- Processes millions of data points in real-time
- Uses machine learning to highlight important patterns
- Adapts to user behavior to show the most relevant information
- Provides interactive exploration capabilities

## Technologies Used

- React for the frontend interface
- Python and TensorFlow for AI/ML components
- D3.js for custom data visualizations
- AWS for cloud infrastructure

## Results

The platform reduced decision-making time by 60% and helped identify new revenue opportunities worth $3.2M in the first quarter after implementation.
